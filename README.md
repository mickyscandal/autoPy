# autoPy

AutoPy is a GUI application (written using Python3 and tkinter(ttk)) for logging
various automotive maintenance tasks, with a focus on tracking fuel fill-ups and
calculating several stats all based around fuel consumption and cost.

This app is my first attempt at both a fully featured application that is
actually good for more than just practice, as well as my first GUI, so anyone
that might come across, this app, **__PLEASE__** feel free to add on to it. I
only ask that if you do make a change or add something that you be willing to
give an explanation of what you did and how it works (keep in mind this is a
  learning project).



## TODO:
1. GUI:
  * create basic 'container' with widgets that appear on all frames
  * build basic (non functioning) GUI for each section(or log, ie gas, maintenance etc.)
  * ...
2. Functionality:
  * list out/create basic calculation functions (mileage, avg mileage, etc)
  * convert code I've already written into a more object oriented design
  * ...
3. Other:
  * ...
