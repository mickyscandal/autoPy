AutoPy is a GUI application (written using Python3 and tkinter(ttk)) for logging
various automotive maintenance tasks, with a focus on tracking fuel fill-ups and
calculating several stats all based around fuel consumption and cost.

This app is my first attempt at both a fully featured application that is
actually good for more than just practice, as well as my first GUI, so anyone
that might come across, this app, **__PLEASE__** feel free to add on to it. I
only ask that if you do make a change or add something that you be willing to
give an explanation of what you did and how it works (keep in mind this is a
  learning project).
